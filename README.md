# The Odin Project Mockup

This mockup of The Odin Project's homepage was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com).

The mockup can be viewed [here](hhttps://naomiflagg.github.io/top-mockup/).

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to build a CSS 12-grid template for current and future use. The template I built is called flaggrid, and the project was built using the template.
